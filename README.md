# So this is supposed to be a website of recipes that I made from zero.
# Create webpage that's functional and readable by a code-reading computer.
# Use elements that make the page functional.
# But not yet be able to make it nice-looking.
# Although most of this will be made by my wordpress theme, I must know how to alter it at least.
# Once I'm done I'll write about what I think I've learned, and about whether it's different from what I expected.
