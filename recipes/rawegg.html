    <img src="images/Egg.jpg" alt="Yep, it's and egg. And no, you didn't make it.">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An egg is a blob of fat and protein, encased by a blob of protein, encased by a porose shell made of calcium and other minerals.</p><p>I know this sounds like a lot of work, and it really is. But to be honest, we're not gonna do most of it. <em>Outsourcing.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>A chicken</li><li>A nest</li><li><strong>Not</strong> having a fox around</li><li>Food for the chicken</li></ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol><li>Give food for the chicken when it's hungry, or look up how often chickens eat whatever it is they eat.</li><li>Wait. Talk to the chicken if you want. Name the chicken, too.</li><li>Check under the chicken daily. Your egg might as well be there.</li><li>This is magic, really. You're casting an egg spell.</li></ol>
